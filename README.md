This is my final project that I presented to complete a course "Game Development with Unity3D" in 2023. 

This project has 5 levels and well-developed mechanisms used in 2D Game Development. Those mechanisms are secret platforms, moving blocks, disappearing blocks, chests, enemies and boss. I hope this project could showcase all the skills that I had developed throughout my entire course.
